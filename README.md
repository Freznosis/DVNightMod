# DVNightMod

Night mod for Derail Valley. Changed lighting, skybox, etc. Cubemaps aren't guaranteed to work since they can update at random times. You are likely to find shiny train cars because of this. You could loop through all reflection probes and call Update/Refresh to fix this.

### Not updated for overhauled.
